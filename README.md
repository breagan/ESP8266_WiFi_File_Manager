# ESP8266_WiFi_File_Manager
These files allow ESP8266 remote file management and control over WiFi

With these files it is possible to add, delete, compile, and run files on the ESP via a web browser.


Files in the Lua_files folder (4) should be uploaded to a freshly formated ESP8266 running NodeMCU.
init.lua should be edited to reflect your LAN SSID and Password settings.

PHP files should be uploaded to a web server on the common LAN with the ESP.
